SUGGESTED DEMO FOCUS
====================
1. Chrome AI integration (1 min)
2. CODE STORYTELLING - MAIN FOCUS (2-3 min)
   - Select code, generate adventure story, show visualizations, export
3. Code Rating (1 min)
4. Security Analysis (1 min)
5. Other features (1-2 min)

Strategy: Spend 50% of demo time on Code Storytelling - it's your differentiator!

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS
====================
